----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenPLC is designed to offer a cheap, open source alternative platform for
control when security and safety are not an issue.  The device uses similar
ladder logic and ModBus protocols as major PLC.  It also can produce and read
24V Hardware IO. Using these tools, this device is capable of performing
comparable work to that of a more expensive PLC.

The code is laid out as follows:
uip     - The open-source TCP-IP stack module
dhcpc   - The DHCP layer.
modbus  - The modbus layer.
usb     - The usb module.
include - Global includes.
lib     - Global Libraries.
core    - The core PLC functions. main is here.
sim     - The interface for the simulator option for this PLC.
logic   - The Logic module: runs ladder logic and maintains virtual registers.
arch    - Architecture-specific functions (i.e. IO, Timers, etc.)
