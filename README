INTRODUCTION

OpenPLC is designed to offer a cheap, open source alternative platform for
control when security and safety are not an issue.  The device uses similar
ladder logic and ModBus protocols as major PLC.  It also can produce and read
24V Hardware IO. Using these tools, this device is capable of performing
comparable work to that of a more expensive PLC.

The code is laid out as follows:
include - Global includes.
lib     - Global Libraries.
logic   - The Logic module: runs ladder logic and maintains virtual registers.
core    - The core PLC functions. main is here.
dhcpc   - The DHCP layer.
uip     - The open-source TCP-IP stack module
usb     - The usb module.
usbstack- The Honken USB stack
arch    - Architecture-specific functions (i.e. IO, Timers, etc.)
