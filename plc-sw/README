OpenPLC is based on the AVR-uIP port done at http://code.google.com/p/avr-uip/.

OpenPLC is broken up into two separate projects:

HILSim - a hardware-in-the-loop simulator
OpenPLC - a PLC that is based completely on open-source software.

It is recommended that you read the README in the doc section. This area is
a hodgepodge of original documentation and updated docs based on what OpenPLC does
differently.

The directory structure look as follows:

apps/     - Example applications
doc/      - Documentation
libs/     - Library code used by some applications and dirvers
uip/      - uIP TCP/IP stack code
drivers/  - Drivers for various hardware
projects/ - different projects that take advantage of the rest of the code.
